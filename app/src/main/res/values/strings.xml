        \n\t\tYou could start a local chapter of IITGAA and connect with alumni in your area. In order to do so, you will be expected to do the following:\n\n

1. Organize a get together at least once in every six months. The get together may be self-financed (people who attend pay for themselves).\n
2. Alternatively, if for some reason it is not possible to organise a self-financed get-together, the IITGAA can help you with financing the event.\n
3. Post photographs of the get-together online.\n
4. Collect / update personal information of the attendees and pass it on to the IITGAA.\n
5. Help collect funds from alumni, if required.
